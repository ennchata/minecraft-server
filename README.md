# minecraft-server

A simple docker based Minecraft server for my friends, made into a git repository for safekeeping.
Uses [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) and [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx), with routing done by [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik).

TODO: better documentation.
